# 🚀 AI Resume Screening App

An intelligent AI-powered Resume Screening system that matches resumes with the most relevant job opportunities using **Sentence Transformers** and **semantic similarity**.

This project demonstrates real-world Natural Language Processing (NLP) skills by building a production-style application capable of understanding resume content and ranking jobs based on relevance.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1️⃣ Resume is uploaded or pasted  
2️⃣ Text is converted into vector embeddings  
3️⃣ Job descriptions are pre-embedded  
4️⃣ Cosine similarity calculates relevance  
5️⃣ Top matches are displayed instantly  

This mimics how modern **Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)** filter candidates.
